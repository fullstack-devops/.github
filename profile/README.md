## Hi to FullStack applications and DevOps solutions (Fs DevOps) 👋

You will probably wonder what you can find here. Feel free to poke around 👓.

- There can be a lot about full stack development and DevOps here.
- Every repo should have at least one readme explaining what it is. Optionally there is even a GitHub Page in the about section.
- Many repos also interact with each other, true to the motto: if you can automate it and it saves you time ➡️ Do IT!

If you have general questions, you are welcome to open an issue in the [.github](https://github.com/fullstack-devops/.github/issues/new) repo or, if you have questions about a suitable topic, directly in the relevant repo.
<!-- Discussions are of course also open. --> 

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
